\usage{
find_beta(x1, p1, x2, p2)

find_beta2(x, se, ci, n)

find_cauchy(x1, p1, x2, p2)

find_normal(x1, p1, x2, p2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{Value for the first percentile.}

\item{p1}{Probability of the first percentile.}

\item{x2}{Value for the second percentile.}

\item{p2}{Probability of the second percentile.}

\item{x}{Numeric, a probability value between 0 and 1. Typically indicates
a prevalence rate of an outcome of interest; Or an integer value
with the number of observed events. In this case, specify \code{n}
to indicate the toral number of observations.}

\item{se}{The standard error of \code{x}. Either \code{se} or \code{ci} must
be specified.}

\item{ci}{The upper limit of the confidence interval of \code{x}. Either
\code{se} or \code{ci} must be specified.}

\item{n}{Numeric, number of total observations. Needs to be specified, if
\code{x} is an integer (number of observed events), and no
probability. See 'Examples'.}
}
\value{
A list of length two, with the two distribution parameters than can
be used to define the distribution, which (best) describes
the shape for the given input parameters.
}
\description{
\code{find_beta()}, \code{find_normal()} and \code{find_cauchy()} find the
shape, mean and standard deviation resp. the location and scale parameters
to describe the beta, normal or cauchy distribution, based on two
percentiles. \code{find_beta2()} finds the shape parameters for a Beta
distribution, based on a probability value and its standard error
or confidence intervals.
}
\details{
These functions can be used to find parameter for various distributions,
to define prior probabilities for Bayesian analyses. \code{x1},
\code{p1}, \code{x2} and \code{p2} are parameters that describe two
quantiles. Given this knowledge, the distribution parameters are
returned. \cr \cr
Use \code{find_beta2()}, if the known parameters are, e.g. a prevalence
rate or similar probability, and its standard deviation or confidence
interval. In this case. \code{x} should be a probability,
for example a prevalence rate of a certain event. \code{se} then
needs to be the standard error for this probability. Alternatively,
\code{ci} can be specified, which should indicate the upper limit
of the confidence interval od the probability (prevalence rate) \code{x}.
If the number of events out of a total number of trials is known
(e.g. 12 heads out of 30 coin tosses), \code{x} can also be the number
of observed events, while \code{n} indicates the total amount of trials
(in the above example, the function call would be: \code{find_beta2(x = 12, n = 30)}).
