\usage{
means_by_group(
  x,
  dv,
  grp,
  weights = NULL,
  digits = 2,
  out = c("txt", "viewer", "browser"),
  encoding = "UTF-8",

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A (grouped) data frame.}

\item{dv}{Name of the dependent variable, for which the mean value, grouped
by \code{grp}, is computed.}

\item{grp}{Factor with the cross-classifying variable, where \code{dv} is
grouped into the categories represented by \code{grp}. Numeric vectors
are coerced to factors.}

\item{weights}{Name of variable in \code{x} that indicated the vector of
weights that will be applied to weight all observations. Default is
\code{NULL}, so no weights are used.}

\item{digits}{Numeric, amount of digits after decimal point when rounding
estimates and values.}

\item{out}{Character vector, indicating whether the results should be printed
to console (\code{out = "txt"}) or as HTML-table in the viewer-pane
(\code{out = "viewer"}) or browser (\code{out = "browser"}), of if the
results should be plotted (\code{out = "plot"}, only applies to certain
functions). May be abbreviated.}

\item{encoding}{Character vector, indicating the charset encoding used
for variable and value labels. Default is \code{"UTF-8"}. Only used
when \code{out} is not \code{"txt"}.}

\item{file}{Destination file, if the output should be saved as file.
Only used when \code{out} is not \code{"txt"}.}
}
\value{
For non-grouped data frames, \code{means_by_group()} returns a data frame with
following columns: \code{term}, \code{mean}, \code{N}, \code{std.dev},
\code{std.error} and \code{p.value}. For grouped data frames, returns
a list of such data frames.
}
\description{
Computes mean, sd and se for each sub-group (indicated by \code{grp})
of \code{dv}.
}
\details{
This function performs a One-Way-Anova with \code{dv} as dependent
and \code{grp} as independent variable, by calling
\code{lm(count ~ as.factor(grp))}. Then \code{\link[emmeans]{contrast}}
is called to get p-values for each sub-group. P-values indicate whether
each group-mean is significantly different from the total mean.
