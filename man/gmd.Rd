\title{Gini's Mean Difference}
\usage{
gmd(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector or data frame.}

\item{...}{Optional, unquoted names of variables that should be selected for
further processing. Required, if \code{x} is a data frame (and no vector)
and only selected variables from \code{x} should be processed. You may also
use functions like \code{:} or tidyselect's \code{select_helpers()}.}
}
\value{
For numeric vectors, Gini's mean difference. For non-numeric vectors
or vectors of length < 2, returns \code{NA}.
}
\description{
\code{gmd()} computes Gini's mean difference for a numeric vector
or for all numeric vectors in a data frame.
}
\note{
Gini's mean difference is defined as the mean absolute difference between
any two distinct elements of a vector. Missing values from \code{x} are
silently removed.
