# sjstats 0.18.3

* Weighted significance tests have been re-designed. The functions `weighted_ttest()`,
  `weighted_mannwhitney()` and `weighted_chisqtest()` are no longer available.
  These are now re-implemented in `t_test()`, `mann_whitney_test()` and
  `chi_squared_test()`. If weights are required, the `weights` argument can be
  used. Furthermore, new functions for significance testing were added:
  `kruskal_wallis_test()` and `wilcoxon_test()`.

* `means_by_group()` and `mean_n()` were removed. The replacements are
  `datawizard::means_by_group()` and `datawizard::row_means()` (using the
  `min_valid` argument).

* `weighted_median()`, `weighted_sd()` and `weighted_mean()` were removed. Their
  replacements are `datawizard::weighted_median()`, `datawizard::weighted_sd()`
  and `datawizard::weighted_mean()`.

* Package dependency was dramatically reduced. _sjstats_ now required much fewer
  and much more light-weight packages to work.

* Some minor bugs were fixed.
